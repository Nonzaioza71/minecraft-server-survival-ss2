# If you wish to remove a list completely from the configuration, don't remove it otherwise the configuration updater
# will add it back to the config, and you'll be back to square one. To solve this, make sure you set the list to []
# For example:
# list: []

# DO NOT TOUCH THIS!

settings:
  # What language do you want the plugin to read? The list langs are in the lang/ folder.

  # If it could not find one, it'll use the default language.
